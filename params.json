This is a new version-controlling method to projects that I've grown fond of. It helps me to organize and collaborate easily. You can download the project, fork it (for your own development), or leave issues/comments on anything that I put on the project's github repo.\r\n\r\nGot questions? You know how to find me. Enjoy!","tagline":"Trent's projects that I conjure up for him.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
